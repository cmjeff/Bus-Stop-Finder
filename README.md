# Bus Stop Finder
Welcome to Bus Stop Finder, a personal project that utilizes the Translink Real Time Transit Information (RTTI) API to help users find bus stops near their current location.

## Features
- Geolocation: The app uses the user's device's GPS to find their current location and display it on a map.
- Bus Stop Identification: The app calls the Translink RTTI API to retrieve a list of nearby bus stops and plots them on the map as selectable points.
- Schedule Information: Upon selecting a bus stop, the app retrieves the schedule information for that stop from the Translink RTTI API and displays it to the user.

## Requirements
- A device with GPS capabilities
- An internet connection
